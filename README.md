[![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/R5R11K2H4)


## Getting Started

Simply open the jupyter notebook and see how some demo on pictures that we uploaded with this repository

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
scikit-image
matplotlib
numpy
```

### Installing

Here are the steps to follow

```
conda install environment.yml
conda activate registration_course
```

## Running the tests

Again, simply run each script (for demo) demon0 if you wanna see the demo for demo0 and respectively for other demons

```
python3 demon0.py
```

### Break down into end to end tests

Our tests are working on three different sets of images. Here are some examples of results and their explanation.

#### Implementation of demon 0
- demons are on are scattererd on the contour of $S$.
- deformation are rigid, so one direction for all pixels
- iterative $\phi_n$ given by the affine transform, so explicit
- magnitude of force same, but correctness still assured since the number of support to exert force supposedly diminish when shapes overlap

DISCLAIMER: the maximum generality we allow ourselves is to deal only with disks of different direction, and allow ourselves only rigid transform plus white background

#### Implementation of demon 1
- demons are on are scattererd on the the full grid of $S$ but where the intensity grad is non-zero.
- free form deformation, effect of force using Gaussian filter
- trilinear interpolation in $M$
- magnitude of force given by optical flow, direction too, so then link back to trilinear interpolation to get final direction and momentum
